        "subTitle":"First impressions are crucial in a job interview, and the right suit can help you make a positive
        impact. Here are some guidelines to help you select the perfect suit for your interview.",

        "imgMain":"suit-job.jpg",

        "titleFirst":"1. Understand the Company Culture",

        "txtFirst":"Research the company's dress code and culture before choosing your suit. For conservative industries
        like finance or law, a classic navy or charcoal suit is appropriate. For more creative fields, you can opt for a
        suit with a bit more personality, but still professional.",

        "titleSecond":"2. Fit is Key",

        "txtSecond":"Ensure your suit fits well. A well-fitted suit should hug your shoulders, not restrict your
        movement, and the trousers should have a slight break at the shoe. Consider getting your suit tailored for a
        perfect fit.",

        "imgSecond":"job-first.jpg",

        "titleThird":"3. Choose the Right Color",

        "txtThird":"Neutral colors like navy, charcoal, and black are safe choices. These colors are professional and
        versatile, making them suitable for most interviews. Avoid bright colors or bold patterns that can be
        distracting.",

        "titleFourth":"4. Pair with a Crisp Dress Shirt",

        "txtFourth":"A white or light blue dress shirt is a classic choice that pairs well with any suit. Make sure the
        shirt is clean, well-pressed, and fits properly. Avoid shirts with excessive patterns or colors.",

        "imgThird":"job-second.jpg",

        "titleFifth":"5. Select a Conservative Tie",

        "txtFifth":"Your tie should complement your suit and shirt without overpowering your look. Solid colors or
        subtle patterns are ideal. Avoid overly bold or novelty ties.",

        "titleSixth":"6. Pay Attention to Details",

        "txtSixth":"Ensure your shoes are polished and in good condition. Match your belt to your shoes, and avoid
        excessive accessories. A simple watch and minimal jewelry are all you need.",

        "txtSixthTwo":"",

        "hideSixth":"hidden",

        "titleSeventh":"7. Grooming Matters",

        "txtSeventh":"In addition to your suit, pay attention to your grooming. Make sure your hair is neat, facial hair
        is trimmed, and nails are clean.",

        "txtSeventhTwo":"By carefully selecting your suit and paying attention to these details, you'll present yourself
        as a polished and professional candidate, ready to make a great impression in your job interview.",
