        "subTitle":"Traveling with a suit can be challenging, especially if you want to avoid wrinkles and keep it
        looking sharp. Here are some tips to ensure your suit arrives at your destination in pristine condition.",

        "imgMain":"suit-travel.jpg",

        "titleFirst":"1. Choose the Right Suit Bag",

        "txtFirst":"Invest in a high-quality, breathable garment bag designed specifically for suits. Look for one
        with ample space and protective features to prevent your suit from getting crushed.",

        "titleSecond":"2. Properly Fold Your Suit Jacket",

        "txtSecond":"Lay your suit jacket flat and button it up. Turn it over so the back is facing up, then fold it in
        half vertically with the shoulders touching. Fold the sleeves over the jacket, then fold the jacket in half
        horizontally. Place it in your garment bag carefully.",

        "imgSecond":"travel-first.jpg",

        "titleThird":"3. Fold the Trousers Neatly",

        "txtThird":"Lay your trousers flat and fold them along the crease. Fold them in half lengthwise and then in
        half again. Place them in the garment bag on top of the folded jacket.",

        "titleFourth":"4. Use Tissue Paper",

        "txtFourth":"Place tissue paper inside the folds to prevent creases. Tissue paper helps maintain the suit's
        shape and reduces friction, which can cause wrinkles.",

        "imgThird":"travel-second.jpg",

        "titleFifth":"5. Pack Strategically",

        "txtFifth":"If you're using a suitcase, place the garment bag on top of your other items to minimize pressure.
        Alternatively, you can use a dedicated suit compartment if your suitcase has one.",

        "titleSixth":"6. Hang Your Suit Upon Arrival",

        "txtSixth":"As soon as you arrive at your destination, remove your suit from the garment bag and hang it up.
        Use a padded hanger to maintain the shape of the shoulders. If wrinkles have formed, use a steamer to gently
        remove them.",

        "txtSixthTwo":"By following these steps, you can ensure your suit stays wrinkle-free and ready to wear, no
        matter where your travels take you.",
